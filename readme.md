## Advent of Code 2022

This is my first year doing AoC. Most days I'm doing my first solution in PHP, but sometimes I throw in a JS, Python, or Rust solution.

Assuming you have Composer, PHP, Python, Node, and Rust/Cargo installed, you can run all tests using composer:

```
composer day1
composer day2
composer day3
composer day4
composer day5
composer day6
```

or

```
composer all
```
